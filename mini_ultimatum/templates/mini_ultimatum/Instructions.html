            Instructions

    </h3>
    <div class="panel-body">
        <p>
            Three players are randomly selected. Your identity will also remain hidden from your the rest.
        </p>
        <p>
            The three participants will have three different roles: the <strong>proposer</strong>, the <strong>responder</strong> and the <strong>punisher</strong>. You will be assigned randomly to a role, and it will be displayed on the next page.
        </p>
        <p>
            The three of you will together receive {{ Constants.endowment }}. The experiment is about how to divide this amount. The proposer will make the responder a take-it-or-leave-it offer, which the responder can accept or reject.
            The punisher will have the option to penalize proposer based on his decision. If the offer is rejected, both proposer and responder receive {{ Constants.payoff_if_rejected }},
            while the Punisher retains {{ Constants.endowment }}.
        </p>
        <h4 class="panel-sub-heading">

                Proposer's role

        </h4>
        <p>
            The proposer has the following {{ Constants.offer_choices_count }} options on how to divide the {{ Constants.endowment }} between the them(proposer and responder).
            <ol>
                {% for give, keep in Constants.keep_give_amounts %}
                <li>{{ give }} for the responder (the proposer keeps {{ keep }})</li>
                {% endfor %}
            </ol>
        </p>
        <h4 class="panel-sub-heading">

                Responder's role

        </h4>
        <p>
            {% if not group.strategy %} The responder can either accept or reject the offer. {% else %} While the proposer makes the offer, the responder can select which {{ Constants.offer_choices_count }} offers stated above to accept or reject. After the proposer has made the offer, it will be either accepted or rejected according to the responder's choices. {% endif %}
        </p>
        <h4 class="panel-sub-heading">

                Punisher's role

        </h4>
        <p>
            The punisher does decide to penalize proposer based on his decision.
        </p>
        <h4 class="panel-sub-heading">

                Results

        </h4>
        <p>
            In the end, when all players have made their decision, a results page will be displayed. Here the offer will be displayed once more, and whether it was accepted or rejected.
        </p>
        <p>
            Furthermore, one of the following two payoffs will be displayed:
            <ul>
                <li>If the offer is accepted, the players will receive a payoff accordingly</li>
                <li>If the offer is rejected, all players will receive {{ Constants.payoff_if_rejected }}</li>
                <li>If the offer is accpeted, and the Punisher penalizes the Proposer then the amount penalized
                    is deducted for both the Punisher and the Proposer.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
